        <p>Tall and elegant, the Azawakh is a West African sighthound who originates from the countries of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. The Azawakh has a short, fine coat which may come in any color or color combinations: red, clear sand to fawn, brindled, parti-color (which may be predominantly white), blue, black and brown. The head may have a black mask and there may be white markings on the legs, bib and at the tip of tail. There are no color or marking disqualifications in the breed. Befitting its heritage, the Azawakh excels as a companion, guardian and a lure courser in the United States.</p>

        <p>This ancient hunting hound is so lean and rangy that his bone structure and musculature can plainly be seen beneath his skin. The smooth S-shaped contours, deep chest, and aerodynamic head mark the Azwakh as a member of the sighthound family, canine sprinters that rely on keen vision and blazing speed to fix and course their prey. The ultrafine coat comes in several colors and patterns. The overall look of this leggy hound is one of elegance and fineness, but don't be fooled: This is a tough, durable hunter who's been chasing gazelle across the scorching sands of the Sahara for more than a thousand years.</p>

        <p>With only an estimated 150 dogs in the States and less than 3,000 worldwide, Azawakh fall in to the category of “threatened” breed populations. These are breeds that are breeds that could cease to exist without continued interested in continuing and perserving them. Many only think of wild species when they think of threatened animals, but there are many domesticated animal breeds that are also at risk.</p>

        <p>The American Azawakh Association (AAA) is the AKC parent club for the Azawakh in the US. The AAA was founded on February 7, 1988 with the goals of promoting the pure Azawakh and to guarantee the breed a permanent future in the US.</p>

        <p>Azawakhs are not the best choice for a first-time dog owner or someone who hasn’t owned a primitive breed. Unlike Golden Retrievers, they are not friendly to strangers. However, they are highly trainable and once you've gained their trust, they are extremely willing to learn just about anything.</p>
