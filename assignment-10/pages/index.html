    <div id="intro">
        <p>EPIC is a loose musical adaptation of Homer's The Odyssey written and composed by Jorge Rivera-Herrans. The storytelling is inspired by video games and animation/anime. The musical is divided into 9 "sagas," with five sagas in Act 1 and four sagas in Act 2. There are currently four albums ("sagas") and 17 songs currently released.</p>

        <p>The EPIC community is comprised of over 410,000 people on TikTok, 15,000 people on Discord, and more across other platforms. This positive and supportive community comes together every day to make fan art, perform song covers, create animatics, and spread the word about the development of EPIC.</p>

        <p>Part of the journey of creating EPIC has been documented by Jorge Rivera-Herrans on his TikTok account.</p>
